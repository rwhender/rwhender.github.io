<p>My name is Wesley Henderson, and I am a Ph.D. student in the electrical engineering program at the University of Mississippi, working with adviser Prof. Paul Goggans. My research interests include the application of Bayesian inference, specifically using nested sampling, to various engineering domains, including room acoustics and transportation networks.</p>

<p>I graduated from Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in 2012 with a master of science degree in architectural sciences with a concentration in acoustics. Under the guidance of Dr. Ning Xiang, I researched the application of Bayesian inference to room acoustic modal analysis. I graduated from Louisiana Tech University in 2011 with a bachelor of science degree in civil engineering. In 2010, I was a research intern at the National Center for Physical Acoustics at the University of Mississippi. While there, I researched fluid-structure interactions with Dr. Nathan Murray and Bernard Jansen.</p>
