My name is Wesley Henderson, and I am a Ph.D. student in the electrical engineering program at the University of Mississippi, working with adviser [Prof. Paul Goggans](http://home.olemiss.edu/~goggans/). My research interests include the development and application of numerical inference techniques, specifically using nested sampling, to various engineering domains, including acoustics and signal processing.

I graduated from Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in 2012 with an M.S. in architectural sciences with a concentration in acoustics. Under the guidance of Dr. Ning Xiang, I investigated the application of Bayesian inference to room acoustic modal analysis. I graduated from Louisiana Tech University in 2011 with a B.S. in civil engineering. In 2010, I was a research intern at the National Center for Physical Acoustics at the University of Mississippi. While there, I investigated fluid-structure interactions with Dr. Nathan Murray and Bernard Jansen.
