My main research interests are as follows:

* The development of efficient numerical Bayesian model comparison techniques with a focus on parallel algorithms, including:
    - Nested sampling
    - Thermodynamic integration
    - Trans-dimensional Markov-chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) (e.g., reversible jump MCMC)
* The application of such techniques to engineering problems in the areas of
    - Acoustics
    - Loudspeaker analysis
    - General signal processing
