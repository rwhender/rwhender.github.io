My main research interests are as follows:

* The application and extension of numerical Bayesian inference techniques, including:
    - Nested sampling
    - Trans-dimensional Markov-chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) (e.g., reversible jump MCMC)
* Analysis of acoustical room modes
* Application of Bayesian inference to the design of intermodal transportation network terminals
