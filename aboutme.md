I am a data scientist with a Ph.D. in the electrical engineering from the University of Mississippi. I graduated in 2019, and my dissertation was entitled "Design and Analysis of Efficient Parallel Bayesian Model Comparison Algorithms." It was supervised by [Prof. Paul Goggans](http://home.olemiss.edu/~goggans/).

I graduated from Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in 2012 with a master of science degree in architectural sciences with a concentration in acoustics. Under the guidance of Dr. Ning Xiang, I investigated the application of Bayesian inference to room acoustic modal analysis. I graduated from Louisiana Tech University in 2011 with a bachelor of science degree in civil engineering.
